-- Part 2: Change the following queries according to the specifications.
-- Include the answers to the follow up questions in a comment below your
-- query.

-- 1. Modify this query so it shows all brands that are not discontinued
-- regardless of whether they have any models in the models table.
-- before:
    -- SELECT b.name,
    --        b.founded,
    --        m.name
    -- FROM Model AS m
    --   LEFT JOIN brands AS b
    --     ON b.name = m.brand_name
    -- WHERE b.discontinued IS NULL;

-- 2. Modify this left join so it only selects models that have brands in the Brands table.
-- before:
    -- SELECT m.name,
    --        m.brand_name,
    --        b.founded
    -- FROM Models AS m
    --   LEFT JOIN Brands AS b
    --     ON b.name = m.brand_name;

-- followup question: In your own words, describe the difference between
-- left joins and inner joins.

-- 3. Modify the query so that it only selects brands that don't have any models in the models table.
-- (Hint: it should only show Tesla's row.)
-- before:
    -- SELECT name,
    --        founded
    -- FROM Brands
    --   LEFT JOIN Models
    --     ON brands.name = Models.brand_name
    -- WHERE Models.year > 1940;

-- 4. Modify the query to add another column to the results to show
-- the number of years from the year of the model until the brand becomes discontinued
-- Display this column with the name years_until_brand_discontinued.
-- before:
    -- SELECT b.name,
    --        m.name,
    --        m.year,
    --        b.discontinued
    -- FROM Models AS m
    --   LEFT JOIN brands AS b
    --     ON m.brand_name = b.name
    -- WHERE b.discontinued NOT NULL;




-- Part 3: Further Study

-- 1. Select the name of any brand with more than 5 models in the database.

-- 2. Add the following rows to the Models table.

-- year    name       brand_name
-- ----    ----       ----------
-- 2015    Chevrolet  Malibu
-- 2015    Subaru     Outback

-- 3. Write a SQL statement to crate a table called `Awards`
--    with columns `name`, `year`, and `winner`. Choose
--    an appropriate datatype and nullability for each column
--   (no need to do subqueries here).

-- 4. Write a SQL statement that adds the following rows to the Awards table:

--   name                 year      winner_model_id
--   ----                 ----      ---------------
--   IIHS Safety Award    2015      the id for the 2015 Chevrolet Malibu
--   IIHS Safety Award    2015      the id for the 2015 Subaru Outback

-- 5. Using a subquery, select only the *name* of any model whose
-- year is the same year that *any* brand was founded.
